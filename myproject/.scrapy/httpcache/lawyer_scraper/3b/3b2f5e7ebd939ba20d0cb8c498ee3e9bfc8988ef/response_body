			<h2>Criminal Defense in California State <br />&amp; Federal Courts</h2>
			<h4> Peter A. Leeming, <br /> State and Federal Criminal Defense Attorney</h4>
		
		<p>Welcome to the website for the Law Offices of Peter A. Leeming.</p>  		<p>I defend people accused of crimes in the State of California and the United States Federal Courts.  I also represent people in cases closely related to criminal actions, such as forfeiture.</p>  		<p>Being charged with a crime is one of the most frightening and potentially destructive things that can happen to a person. The search for an attorney is difficult because of the high stakes involved and 			because often there is tremendous pressure to find a lawyer in a hurry.  Nevertheless, it is important to take the time and find the right person to help you.</p>  		<p>I have been a criminal defense lawyer exclusively since 1985. I fight hard for each of my clients whether the person is accused of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), &quot;white collar&quot; offenses or capital murder.   My clients include individuals and business entities charged with money laundering, tax or regulatory offenses.</p>  		<p>When you hire me you can count on thorough representation with a carefully chosen team of experts who have devoted their lives to protecting your rights no matter what the circumstances.</p>
